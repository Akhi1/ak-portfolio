# Portfolio

## About 
This is a Portfolio Design Project developed as a part of my Front End Development learning

This project doesnot use any front end framework and is built from scratch

This is still a Work Under Process.........

## Planning
• Will optimise the code to work on cross platform/browsers

• Will re-implement the website using popular front-end frameworks 

• Will add Responsive web design features

• Will optimise code to minify the load time

• Will optimise code to reduce the restructuring issues for easy code reuse

• Will provide a proper documentation refering all the online resources used
